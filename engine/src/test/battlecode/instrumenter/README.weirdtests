We're doing some moderately torturous things to the JVM with our instrumentation, so it only makes sense
that our tests are slightly torturous.

- Why do these files have the wrong package at the top??
  Gradle will move them into the right place. Ignore that.

- Why are there class files in my source directory??
  We have to load several class files in the tests that are inconvenient to generate at compile time.
  ValueA.class is compiled from a class called Value and has a static method getValue that returns 'A';
  ValueB.class is compiled from a class called Value and has a static method getValue that returns 'B'.
  java.lang.Double.class is an (incorrect) implementation of Double.

- Why????
  I lie awake at night, sometimes, thinking about that question.
