# Specs

Game specs are in `specs.md`, which is the source of truth.

We're using `Markdeep` to generate a pretty HTML version of the specs. Write the specs in Markdown, and ensure that the Markdeep header/footer tags are present. See samples on the Markdeep website for detailed usage.

The following files are legacy from when we used Pandoc, and are not used in the current build.

- `css/*` except for `css/journal.css`
- `fonts/`
- `js/*` except for `js/markdeep.min.js`
- `template.html`
